      <h3>SERVICES</h3>
      <p>
        CEM Wallet is a non-custodial wallet software, for digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, virtual commodities and NFTs (“Digital Assets”), meaning you are solely in control of and responsible for your Digital Assets and private keys, and accordingly you can authorize transactions from your wallet address. You expressly acknowledge and agree that as CEM Wallet is a non-custodial wallet software, you are solely responsible for your activity and any risk of loss at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        CEM Wallet allows you to:
      </p>
      <div class="roadmap_point" />
      generate wallet addresses and associated private keys that you may use to send and receive digital assets;
      <br />
      <div class="roadmap_point mt" />
      browse and access third party decentralized application(s) (“DApp(s)”) and third party decentralized exchanges (“DEX”) through the mobile application’s web browser;
      <br />
      <div class="roadmap_point mt" />
      swap/trade digital assets through DApp functionality made available by third party service provider(s);
      <br />
      <div class="roadmap_point mt" />
      stake certain digital assets in a third party ‘proof of stake’ network through staking services (“Staking Service”);
      <br />
      <div class="roadmap_point mt" />
      view digital asset price information made available by third party service provider(s); and broadcast Digital Asset Transaction data to various blockchains supported by CEM Wallet without requiring you to download or install the associated blockchain-based software to your local device.
      <p />
      <h3>Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities</h3>
      <p>
        An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on eligible devices. The private key is associated with the wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Digital Assets to and from that wallet address. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase (“Secret Phrase”) associated with your wallet. You must keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase, and private key access information secure. It is very important that you backup your private keys, backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Digital Assets associated with your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or Secret Phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot generate a new password for your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such wallet address will become inaccessible. Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase and private key information secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Use of DApps and DEX</h3>

Any updated fees will apply to any transaction that occurs following the effective date of the updated fees.
      </p>

      <h3>Use of Staking Service</h3>
      <p>
        If you access or use the Staking Service, a third party may stake certain Digital Assets on your behalf (“Staked Digital Assets”), acting as a transaction validator on the applicable blockchain network. If a block of transactions is successfully validated using such Staked Digital Assets, a reward is granted by that network (“Staking Reward”). You acknowledge and agree that CEM Wallet is not responsible for: (i) your use of the Staking Service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of the Staking Service; (ii) ensuring Staking will occur on a continuous basis; and (iii) ensuring any particular Digital Asset will be staked or will continue to be staked.

        If you use CEM Wallet to purchase Digital Assets with your credit or debit card, a third party will convert your chosen amount into the applicable Digital Asset and credit it to your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) CEM Wallet is not responsible for your use of such third party service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of such service; (ii) you will be subject to any terms and conditions imposed by the relevant third party service provider; (iii) CEM Wallet has no ability to change, withdraw or cancel any conversion requests you place; (iv) CEM Wallet is not responsible for any exchange rates offered by the relevant third party service provider(s); and (v) CEM Wallet is not responsible for any fees charged by the relevant third party service provider(s) or your bank or credit card issuer(s).

      <h3>Digital Asset Transactions</h3>
      <p>
        In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and recorded in the Digital Asset’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using CEM Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) we do not have the ability to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction; (ii) the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks; (iii) we do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets; and (iv) any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us and therefore we do not guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all risks related to the use of the Services and you shall be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your private key. When you create a wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong unique password that you do not use for any other purpose (i.e. different to your phone password or any other passwords you use for websites, online services, etc.) and leveraging biometric authentication if available; (b) do not store the private key and Secret Phrase in plain text online or in an unsecured physical location; (c) limiting access to your devices and your wallet; (d) taking all necessary precautions against malware on your devices and networks; and (e) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your wallet.

Maintaining an external backup of any wallet address and private key pairs associated with your wallet will allow you to access the blockchain network upon which your wallet is secured. Such a backup will allow you to fully restore your wallet at any time without cost or loss of your Digital Assets. If you do not maintain a backup of your wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access the Digital Assets associated with your wallet. CEM Wallet shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss of Digital Assets in the event that we discontinue all or any part of the Services.

      <h3>NO WAIVER</h3>
      <p>
        Our failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of us. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise.

        If it turns out that any part of this Agreement is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or elimination of the term shall not affect or impair the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision or any other terms, clauses or provisions of these Terms.

If we are unable to perform our Services outlined in the Terms due to factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the aforementioned force majeure events or changes in applicable laws and/or sanctions policies, we shall not be liable for the Services provided under these Terms during the time period coincident with the event in question.
