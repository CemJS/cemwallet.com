In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that CEMWallet or substantially all of its assets are acquired, users' information will be one of the transferred assets. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners- like publishers, advertisers, developers, or right holders."
